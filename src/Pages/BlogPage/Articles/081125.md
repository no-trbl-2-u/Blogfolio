# Intro

All my life I've been interested in the seemingly never-ceasing battle between logic and faith. I was raised to be Catholic. Before I was born, my parents spoke in tongues. Later on, they lost their faith as the end of the 90's were just too much for them. Mass-company buyouts, "non-addictive" perscription opiates, raves, infidelity, it was a hard time for them. But then after their divorce, and their 30's calmed down a little bit, they both found their faith again and got their lives back. My father has an incredibly strong, unshakable faith that the Christian God, is the real God, the only God, and is all-powerful, all-knowing, etc. For a long, long, time, I fought tooth and nail. I was an Atheist with a special interest in Taoism and Science/Logic. I would later realize that I literally grabbed both ends of the spectrum and I mostly just cherry-picked Taoist beliefs when they suited me and a basic misunderstanding of existentialist philosophers. I was the captain of my own ship even if I steer this ship into an endless cycle of self-destruction only coming to a stand-still at 36 years old. It was less of a "stand-still" and more of a crash and burn but that's not what I'd like to focus on right now. What I want to talk about is the outcome of that. No I didn't "Find God" as I put the pieces of my life back together like so many other people who reach the lowest point in their life and find God waiting to explain away their sin and their suffering. Instead, I decided: "I don't know anything". I don't really know the Christian God I've been rejecting. I don't really know the Jewish or Bhuddist God. Shit, I don't know anything about polytheistic religions outside my interest in Norse Mythology. All of this to say, I've decided to start all over with an open mind and without any assumptions. I'm no longer under the assumption God "definitely" doesn't exist. That's just as difficult to believe as God "definitely" exists. So starting all over, I've also decided to try to learn about philosophers I previously ignored because they were theistic, learn about formal logic, and I've decided to document it all so that I can return one day and see my progression. Plus, I mean, I have to fill this blog up with something.

## Help of AI

I've been getting pretty good with AI prompts lately and I've narrowed it down to these 3 tips:
1) Tell it what it is in the context of what you're asking
2) Tell it you want multiple instances of what you're looking for
3) Ask it "Before you start, do you have any questions?"

Between all 3, you get information beyond laymen's terms and surface level filler. You get multiple instances of what you want so you can shop around. And lastly, you can make sure that it fully understands you and what you're asking.

Here's an example:

>"Assume the role of a Philosophy professor with a predominant focus on Theistic Existentialism. Give me 5 examples of seemingly air-tight arguments that support the existence of God based on previous philosophers. Now give me 5 seemingly air-tight arguments that support God doesn't exist. Finally, develop a comprehensive learning plan, including resources, for me to learn 1 argument and 1 counter-argument everyday for the next 5 days. Do you have any questions?"

_I bet you asked yourself "What do AI tips have to do with God? What kind of segue is this?" and then boom, God._

Here was the response and ultimately, the topic for the next for days:

### Five Arguments Supporting God's Existence
1. Aquinas's Cosmological Argument (First Cause)
Everything in motion was set in motion by another. Since infinite regress is impossible, there must be a First Mover - God. The logical structure appears unassailable: either infinite causal chains exist (seemingly absurd) or a necessary first cause exists.
2. Anselm's Ontological Argument (Refined by Plantinga)
God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived. A God who exists in reality is greater than one who exists only in understanding. Therefore, God must exist in reality. Plantinga's modal version using possible worlds seems to close traditional loopholes.
3. Paley's Design Argument (Updated by Fine-Tuning)
The universe's fundamental constants are so precisely calibrated for life that random chance seems impossible. The probability of our universe supporting life without intelligent design is astronomically small - suggesting divine craftsmanship.
4. Kierkegaard's Existential Argument
Human existence reveals an infinite qualitative difference between finite and infinite, temporal and eternal. Our capacity for despair, our longing for the absolute, and our experience of the paradox of existence point to a transcendent source of meaning.
5. The Moral Argument (Craig's Kalam version)
If God doesn't exist, objective moral values don't exist. Objective moral values do exist. Therefore, God exists. The alternative - moral relativism - seems to contradict our deepest intuitions about justice and human dignity.

### Five Arguments Against God's Existence
1. The Logical Problem of Evil (Mackie)
If God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, evil shouldn't exist. Evil exists. Therefore, God (as traditionally conceived) doesn't exist. The logical inconsistency appears insurmountable without abandoning one of God's classical attributes.
2. The Argument from Divine Hiddenness (Schellenberg)
A loving God would ensure that sincere seekers could find reasonable evidence of divine existence. Many sincere, lifelong seekers find no such evidence. Therefore, such a God likely doesn't exist.
3. The Problem of Religious Pluralism
If one particular God exists, we'd expect clearer evidence favoring that tradition. Instead, we find equally sincere believers across incompatible religious traditions with mutually exclusive claims. This suggests human projection rather than divine reality.
4. Hume's Critique of Natural Theology
Our concepts and reasoning are limited by human experience. We cannot validly infer from finite, temporal experience to an infinite, eternal being. All arguments for God's existence commit logical fallacies or exceed the bounds of possible knowledge.
5. The Evolutionary Argument Against Theism
Evolution by natural selection provides a comprehensive explanation for apparent design without invoking intelligence. Human cognitive tendencies toward agency detection and pattern-seeking explain religious belief as adaptive but false beliefs about reality.
